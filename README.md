# Project 1: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
**Author:** Jameka Haggins 

For this cumulative assessment on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I chose the Frontend Mentor URL Shortening API Landing Page project as my subject.

## Reflection
`Write a 200-300 word reflection discussing your development process, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and potential improvements.`

I decided to go with the url shortening project because it seemed really straightforward, I wanted to purely focus the fundementals that we've learned so far, and not pull my hair out while working on this project. Of course the HTML and CSS are never a problem with me, but the Javascript can be a bit of a challenge...since in the past I never was taught it in depth. But through this class and the amazing instructors I'm understanding things more, and all the puzzle pieces are coming together.

As I said before, I started with the bones of the project (html) first so that I can get a visual and understand where I'm going with things. I tried my best to not focus too much on the styling in the beginning; however when it to certain portions of the project, mostly the url shortening input, I had to break away and start working on the javascript. I feel that was possibly the biggest part of the project, because I really needed to make sure that things were working...before I started to complete the rest of the project.

Now for the challening part: unnecessary divs! Learning more about not having them because they get in the way of the layout, and I remembered reading something about having too many nested divs can mess up things with search engines. Of course, I always run into errors when it comes to Javascript because I lose track of what classes I have named specific things. Not only that, but when you're staring at something for so long, even the smallest typo can be overlooked. This happened many times with me. Also commits as you go have saved me so many times, especially when I change something and it screws with the looks of the site, just revert and we're good. 

Potential improvements? I think the shorten portion of the site where you plug in the url, changing that to fit how the design looks more. I had trouble with the mobile optimization, and if I didn't rage quit, I'm sure it would've looked better. Wanted to make the links into a hamburger menu, but I got frustrated with it in the end, so I scrapped that. But yeah honestly a lot of the improvements on my end are style centered.
